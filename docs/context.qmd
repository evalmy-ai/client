## Context specification

You can specify the context of the text comparison, such as what matters to you the most and what could rather be ignored.

To do this, simply add the context into the input data structure.

``` python
data = {
    "expected": "There are three apples, seven oranges, and one banana in the basket.",
    "actual":   "In the basket there are thee apples, and four pears.",
    "context":  "I am interested in the apples only, ignore all the other fruits."
}
```

The result without any context:

``` json
{
    "contradictions": {
        "scores": {
            "score": 0.5
        },
        "reasoning": {
            "statements": [
                {
                    "severity": "large",
                    "summary": "Different types and counts of fruit in the basket.",
                    "reasoning": "The statement from <TEXT 1> mentions 'three apples, seven oranges, and one banana' in the basket, while <TEXT 2> states there are 'three apples, and four pears' in the basket. This presents a large contradiction because the types and counts of fruit are significantly different between the two texts. The presence of oranges and a banana in the first text and the mention of pears in the second text, which are not found in the first, changes the overall context of the basket's contents."
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The result with context applied:

``` json
{
    "contradictions": {
        "scores": {
            "score": 1.0
        },
        "reasoning": {
            "statements": [
                {
                    "severity": "negligible",
                    "summary": "The number of apples is consistent.",
                    "reasoning": "Both <TEXT 1> and <TEXT 2> state that there are three apples in the basket. This information is consistent across both texts, and since the context specifies to focus on apples only, the presence or absence of other fruits mentioned in the texts is irrelevant. Therefore, there are no contradictions regarding the number of apples."
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
