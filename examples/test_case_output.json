In <TEXT 2>, the length is given as 13 thousand miles. To determine if there is a contradiction, we need to convert miles to kilometers or vice versa. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.60934 kilometers, 13 thousand miles would be approximately 20,921.42 kilometers. The two lengths given are relatively close, with <TEXT 1> suggesting a slightly longer length than what the conversion of <TEXT 2> would suggest. However, the Great Wall of China is commonly cited as being approximately 21,196 kilometers long, which aligns more closely with <TEXT 1>. Given the context of evaluating a school test where factual clarity and particular numbers are important, this discrepancy in length is significant enough to be considered a contradiction. However, since both texts are attempting to convey that the Great Wall is very long and the numbers are not drastically different, the severity of this contradiction is small.",
