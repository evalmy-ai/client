However, <TEXT 2> states that it is 13 thousand miles long. To determine if there is a contradiction, we need to convert miles to kilometers or vice versa. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.60934 kilometers, 13 thousand miles would be approximately 20,921.42 kilometers. This conversion shows that the lengths provided in both texts are relatively close, with <TEXT 1> suggesting a slightly longer length than what the conversion of <TEXT 2> would suggest. Given the context of evaluating a school test where factual clarity and particular numbers are important, this difference is significant enough to be considered a contradiction. However, since the main informational value that the Great Wall is very long remains the same, and the numbers are not drastically different, the severity of this contradiction is small.",

In contrast, <TEXT 2> simplifies the duration to 'A hundred years,' which is factually incorrect and lacks the specificity required by the context of a school test that demands factual clarity and particular numbers.
